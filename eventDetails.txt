For the first few months in your term, you familiarise yourself with your office
input
Firstly, you receive a report stating that safety standards in water treatment plants around the country are below standard.
Begin safety inspections around water treatment plants
My time can be used for more important things than this
input
Some time later, you are invited to give a couple words to the press about your new position, they ask for a quote about what kind of policy you might enact
"It is unfortunate to admit that there are some issues with the current state of affairs, I will try my best to flatten every irregularity, using every authority given to me"
"The state of water treatment is rather well, and any issues can be trusted to resolve themselves, there is nothing to worry about"
no
Following the interview, you see your image in a column in the newspaper, with a headline reading "New State Water Treatment manager reveals controversial plan!"
input
A couple months later, you receive an alarming report. The water flowing to a specific town has been contaminated, due to a sewage network overflowing nearby a water distribution channel. What shall be done about this?
Redirect water flow through a different channel, we cannot let the town go without clean water. Then send a message to the minister for sanitation, telling him to fix the sewage problems
Take time to repair and clean the sewage pipes, and issue a message to the minister for sanitation about this problem
no
Some months later, you notice that you have a scheduled tour coming up for a water treatment facility which recently had a change in managerial leadership.
no
The day arrives, and you are toured around by the facility's new manager. He greets you warmly and leads you around the premises. Immediately you come across some employees lounging inside without high visibility vests, which scurry out of sight once they realise you are here.
no
You continue the tour, and are shown a large container of chemical solution used for destroying bacteria in water, however, you also spot that the vessel appears quite damaged, as if often re-used, despite the fact that this sort of container should be disposed of and replaced frequently.
no
The tour ends with you being shown around the office space, which is rather unkempt, and as you walk, you almost slip on a wet spot of floor, which has not been marked with a wet floor sign.
input
As you prepare to leave the facility, the manager of it shakes your hand and slips a thick envelope into it with a smile. Once outside you manage to check the contents and find a large amount of money, enough to keep your personal bills and responsibilities  in check for a season...
I will not be bribed, this incompetent manager will not stay in control of this plant so long as I have the power to put an end to it.
Well... Sometimes you must be pragmatic, perhaps it could be the start of a long term business relationship (take the money).
no
Two months after this, you receive a phone call regarding the broken and overflowing sewage system. You are told that it has finally been Fixed and cleaned out, and that the system is ready to be used again as it was. 
input
for the next few months, you find yourself dealing with a massive amount of paperwork, so much so that you realise you are spending almost no time at home or with family, rarely relaxing. You think about what you might do about it all?
Grit your teeth and work harder, stay in the office all night for a while, and then this will all be cleared up
Relax a bit and book a vacation to Spain for a short week, you deserve to let back and be with your close ones
no
You enact your decision, and immediately get busy with what you planned to do
